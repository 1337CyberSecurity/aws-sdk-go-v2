// Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise is in preview release and is subject to
// change. We recommend that you use the service only with test data, and not in
// production environments. While Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise is in preview,
// you must download the preview Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI to use the API
// operations for this service. These API operations aren't available in the public
// Amazon Web Services SDK or CLI. For more information, see Preview Amazon Web
// Services SDK and CLI
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/developerguide/preview-sdk-cli.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide. Amazon Web Services
// IoT FleetWise is a fully managed service that you can use to collect, model, and
// transfer vehicle data to the Amazon Web Services cloud at scale. With Amazon Web
// Services IoT FleetWise, you can standardize all of your vehicle data models,
// independent of the in-vehicle communication architecture, and define data
// collection rules to transfer only high-value data to the cloud. For more
// information, see What is Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise?
