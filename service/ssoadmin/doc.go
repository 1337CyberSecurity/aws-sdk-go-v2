// Package ssoadmin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// Amazon Web Services Single Sign On helps you securely create, or connect, your
// workforce identities and manage their access centrally across Amazon Web
// Services accounts and applications. Amazon Web Services SSO is the recommended
// approach for workforce authentication and authorization in Amazon Web Services,
// for organizations of any size and type. Although Amazon Web Services Single
// Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore API namespaces will continue to
// retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more
// information, see Amazon Web Services SSO rename
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
// This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
// could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For
// information about Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the Amazon Web Services
// SSO User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html). Many
// operations in the Amazon Web Services SSO APIs rely on identifiers for users and
// groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with
// principals and principal IDs in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Identity Store
// API Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).
// Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
// various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and
// more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Amazon
// Web Services SSO and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information
// about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them,
// see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
