## Announcements
We’re happy to share the updated clients for the v0.25.0 preview version of the AWS SDK for Go V2.

The updated clients leverage new developments and advancements within AWS and the Go software ecosystem at large since 
our original preview announcement. Using the new clients will be a bit different than before. The key differences are: 
simplified API operation invocation, performance improvements, support for error wrapping, and a new middleware architecture.
So below we have a guided walkthrough to help try it out and share your feedback in order to better influence the features 
you’d like to see in the GA version.
